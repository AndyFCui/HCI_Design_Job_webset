# About project 
- As international students, we often face various restrictions when job hunting. To address this, we designed a job-search website based on HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) specifically for students. We took into consideration various CRAP (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity) design principles and conducted several peer reviews and user tests.
