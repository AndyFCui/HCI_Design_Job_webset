# About project 
- As international students, we often face various restrictions when job hunting. To address this, we designed a job-search website based on HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) specifically for students. We took into consideration various CRAP (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity) design principles and conducted several peer reviews and user tests.

The Qualtrics Survey Usability Test
The testers start the usability test after entering their participant ID.
1.	The testers are asked to login the app with the credential we provide to them
●	Task 1: Authentication (log in with NU credentials)
2.	The testers play the role of a student who just finished their co-op. They found that they would like to add a review to one of the jobs.
●	Task 2: Adding and rating a co-op on various parameters
